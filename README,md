This is a decompilation of the game *Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance*.
**It is known to not compile**, and will not for many years. Use for reference only.

Only the base executable of *Forged Alliance* is presented here - no gamedata is present.

Names come from both class `type_info` data and external vestigial dll symbols from when
the game was in a dynamically-linked phase of development that were blessedly included
in tandem with the original map editor.
Basic file structure comes from scattered assertations left in release containing file paths.

It was compiled using MSVC 8.0 and developed with Visual Studio 2005.

The following libraries are known to be used (outside of the in-house GPG ones).
Though not included in this repository, the important ones are easy to find:
  * Boost 1.34.X (could be either 1.34.0 or 1.34.1 - both released before November 2007,
    but interesting, after *Supreme Commander* in February, meaning boost was updated)
  * LuaPlus 5.0 build 1081 (with slight modifications to Lua threads)
  * WX Widgets 2.4.2 (MSW version, though using the portable build)
  * Wild Magic 3.8 (a physics library now called Geometric Tools)
  * zlib 1.2.3 (also included in WX but seems to be included separately as well)
  * BugSplat
  * CRI Middleware (Sofdec and ADX) - proprietary
  * DirectX 9 & 10 (including XACT audio engine) - DX10 is not fully enabled and does not work
